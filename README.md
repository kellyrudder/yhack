# EcoStyle

Google Chrome Extension working to lessen the impact of Fast Fashion.

Users can see a company's sustainability rating without having to navigate to a third party site to help make more informed purchasing decisions. If available, we provide users with secondhand options for the items they are viewing to encourage secondhand shopping without the hassle of navigating through different websites. 

We're making it easier to be an informed consumer and to make the switch to secondhand shopping!
